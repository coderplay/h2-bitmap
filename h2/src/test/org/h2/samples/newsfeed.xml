                    <![CDATA[A new version of H2 is available for download at http://www.h2database.com
                    Changes and new functionality:
                    
                    - The GCJ version for Windows is no longer included in the download.
                      It was not stable in this release.
                    - ORDER BY now uses an index if possible.
                      Queries with LIMIT with ORDER BY
                      are faster when the index can be used.
                    - Statements containing LIKE are now re-compiled when executed.
                      Depending on the data, an index on the column is used or not.
                    - New option to disable automatic closing of a database
                      when the virtual machine exits.
                      Database URL: jdbc:h2:test;db_close_on_exit=false
                    - New event: DatabaseEventListener.closingDatabase()
                    - Connection.getCatalog() now returns the database name
                    - The function DATABASE() now return the short name
                    - Automatic starting of a web browser for Mac OS X should work now.
                    
                    Security:
                    
                    - TCP Server: Can now specifiy a password (tcpPassword).
                    - New option -ifExists for the TCP and ODBC server
                      to disallow creating new databases.
                      
                    Bugfixes:
                    
                    - Issue #103: Shutdown of a TCP Server from command line
                      didn't always work.
                    - Issue #104: A HAVING condition on a column
                      that was not in the GROUP BY list didn't work.
                    - Issue #105: RUNSCRIPT (the command) didn't commit
                      after each command if autocommit was on.
                    - Issue #106: SET commands where not persisted
                    - Issue# 107: When executing scripts that contained inserts
                      with many columns, an OutOfMemory error could occur.
                    - Issue #108: There is a concurrency problem when multi threads
                      access the same database.
                    - Issue #109: ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN can make
                      the database unusable.
