Corrupted database

I am sorry to say that, but it looks like a corruption problem. I am very interested in analyzing and solving this problem. Corruption problem have top priority for me. I have a few question:

- What is your database URL?
- What version H2 are you using?
- Do you use any settings or special features (for example, the setting LOG=0, or two phase commit, linked tables, cache settings)?
- On what operating system, file system, and virtual machine?
- How big is the database?
- Is the database usually closed normally, or is process terminated forcefully or the computer switched off?
- Is it possible to reproduce this problem using a fresh database (sometimes, or always)?
- Are there any other exceptions (maybe in the .trace.db file)? Could you send them to me please?
- Was the database originally created with an older version of H2?
- Do you still have any .trace.db files, and if yes could you send them?
- Could you send me the .data.db file where this exception occurs?
