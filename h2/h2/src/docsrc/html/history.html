<h2>History of this Database Engine</h2>
<p>
The development of H2 was started in May 2004,
but it was first published on December 14th 2005.
The author of H2, Thomas Mueller, is also the original developer of Hypersonic SQL.
In 2001, he joined PointBase Inc. where he created PointBase Micro.
At that point, he had to discontinue Hypersonic SQL, but then the HSQLDB Group was formed
to continued to work on the Hypersonic SQL codebase.
The name H2 stands for Hypersonic 2; however H2 does not share any code with
Hypersonic SQL or HSQLDB. H2 is built from scratch.

<h3>Not Planned</h3>
<ul>
<li>HSQLDB does/did support this: select id i from test where i>0 (other databases don't)
</li><li>String.intern (so that Strings can be compared with ==) will not be used because some VMs have problems when used extensively
</li></ul>
